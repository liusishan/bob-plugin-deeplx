# bob-plugin-deeplx
This is a DeepL plugin for Bob. Based on [OwO-Network/DeepLX](https://github.com/OwO-Network/DeepLX).

## Intro
The functionality of this plugin is the same as the old [clubxdev/bob-plugin-deeplx](https://github.com/clubxdev/bob-plugin-deeplx). 
The original author has stopped maintaining it, but DeepL supports new languages, so I had to rewrite a plugin to support all languages. This plugin and [OwO-Network/DeepLX](https://github.com/OwO-Network/DeepLX) are now maintained by me.
